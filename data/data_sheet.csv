Dusty roads put an additional risk 
on a conventional automatic

system to provide an air-fuel ratio that ensures 
superior performance, and fuel efﬁciency. The

pipes and joints to avoid corrosion and leakage in 
the entire CNG structure. Integrated wire harnesses 
are used to eliminate short-circuiting and a 
microswitch ensures that the vehicle does not start 
during CNG fuel ﬁlling process.
SAFETY GOES BOLD
The bold does not hold back on safety. That’s 
why, we have amped up the safety quotient for 
the New Age Baleno meticulously. For the ﬁrst 
time ever, Baleno gets 6 Airbags (Front, Side and 
Curtain). No matter what the weather conditions 
are, the signiﬁcantly enhanced stability of the 
vehicle ensure a pleasurable driving experience.

ESP with Hill Hold Assist, which prevents the loss 
of traction on all wheels. ESP helps in improved 
vehicle control during cornering, immediate lane 
change to avoid obstacles & provides more 
stability while driving on uneven or broken 
roads. The New Age Baleno also gets enhanced 
high speed straight line stability as well as better 
steering returnability, and enhanced braking for 
greater control on your bold drives. In addition 
to that, the Baleno is also loaded with ISOFIX 
mounts, Speed Alert System, Seat Belt reminder 
for all occupants, Rear Parking Assist Sensors & 
many more safety features.

CVT: THE 
ULTIMATE 
AUTOMATIC
6-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSIONDeveloped as part of Earth Dreams Technology, CVT or Continuously Variable 
Transmission is Honda innovation at its best. Since power from the engine is 
continuously fed to the car tyres, CVT makes the ride smoother. It ensures the engine 
performs within a speed range that is best for fuel efﬁciency with 7-Speed Paddle 
Shifters, new Step Up-shift and Brake Down-shift control. Elevate your rush with the 
supremacy of Honda CVT.
The Manual Transmission (MT) features 6 forward speed ratios. 
This achieves a better driving experience with improved fuel efﬁciency.
The 5 gear ratios are optimized for thrilling pick-up/acceleration, while the 6th gear 
overdrive ratio maximises stress-free low engine revolutions
when cruising at high speeds and this is what obtains better fuel efﬁciency. • 7-Speed CVT i-VTEC (Petrol) - 18.4 km/l**
• 6-Speed MT i-VTEC (Petrol) - 17.8 km/l**
T&C apply.ACE™ stands for Advanced Compatibility Engineering™, and it’s a Honda-exclusive body 
design that uses a network of front frame structures to absorb and deﬂect the energy 
from a frontal collision. This helps reduce the force transferred to the cabin and more 
evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles involved. That means it’s not just 
Honda drivers that are safer in the event of a collision-it’s everybody. Add to this the 
world’s ﬁrst i-SRS Airbag System with Quick Deployment Technology, as well as the 1st

Diesel Engine with ISG T echnology
C 220d and C 300d - OM654M
First diesel engine to have the integrated starter alternator (ISG) from Mercedes-Benz India. The 
4-cylinder diesel engines with 48 V on-board electrical system deliver a great deal but need very 
little. Thanks to the integrated starter-alternator with Boost function as well as improved injection 
and turbocharging, it has been possible to increase output and torque even further. Significantly 
less noise and vibrations bring the level of refinement to that of petrol engines. NANOSLIDE® 
helps with being the ideal lubrication, reduces friction and maximizes wear resistance. Thanks to 
extremely hard cylinder contact faces with minuscule pores for oil absorption. The rated output of 
C 220d is 147 kW and C 300d is 195 kW.
Petrol Engine with ISG T echnology
C 200 - M254
Tremendous pulling power even at low engine speeds – this is what characterises this advanced 
4-cylinder petrol engine with 48-volt on-board electrical system. This gives you extra power 
boost and recupuration when required. This supplies, among other things, the integrated starter 
alternator, which is able to deliver additional torque of up to 200 Nm. Despite its temperament, 
the engine is fuel-efficient, low on emissions and has pleasantly smooth running characteristics.
The CONICSHAPE honing of the cylinder barrels, in which the cylinder barrel widens towards the 
bottom in the shape of a trumpet, thereby reduces friction for less wear and lower consumption. The 
aluminum crankcase with cylinder barrel featuring NANOSLIDE technology for a friction-optimized 
cylinder contact surface, is very wear-resistant and so thin that it enables optimum heat transfer.

Active Brake Assist
• If a pedestrian collides head-on with a vehicle travelling in the speed range 25 to 55 km/h, a   
 sophisticated sensor system controlled by intelligent algorithms will trigger various actuators. 
• These are pyrotechnical elements that raise the bonnet in the hinge area by about 80 mm. 
• The increase in distance between the bonnet and the components inside the engine    
 compartment creates an additional deformation space that, in certain accident situations,   
 can help reduce the risk of injury to pedestrians.• This assistant can help to avoid collisions with moving or stationary vehicles in front, with   
 oncoming traffic when making a turn and with moving pedestrians as well as cyclists. 
• As part of this, in addition to distance and collision warning, the system primarily also offers   
 situation-appropriate braking assistance – right up to autonomous emergency braking.

*Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is not a substitute for human eye and driver vigilance, it is a driver assist system that enhances driving experience and safety.

40 km/h
40 km/hADAPTIVE CRUISE
CONTROL (ACC)
Adaptive Cruise Control senses 
and monitors the road ahead and automatically accelerates or decelerates for maintaining a proper distance from the vehicle 
in front. Thanks to the Bend 
Cruise Assistance (BCA), the 
vehicle automatically decelerateswhen entering a curve based on your driving speed and curve radius.
TRAFFIC JAM
ASSIST (TJA)
Trafﬁc Jam Assist (TJA) works 
in conjunction with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Keep Assist (LKA) to let youcruise through heavy trafﬁc with 
complete safety and comfort. By keeping the vehicle in middle of the lane and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, TJA securely and comfortably takes you through jams withminimal effort.
Features and Speciﬁcations may vary model wise.
LANE DEPARTURE
WARNING (LDW)
If, the vehicle is ‘unintentionally’ 
deviating from its lane without giving an indicator, to keepyou inside the  lane, the Lane 
Departure Warning (LDW)function identiﬁes lane markings 
on the road and warns the driver through visual and acoustic signals or steering wheel vibrations to ensure you stay inside the lane.
FORWARD COLLISION
WARNING (FCW)
This system alerts the driver about 
a potential front collision danger with a vehicle or a pedestrian when the gap becomes too close. So, that the driver can react effectively to avoid or reduce the collision. In addition, Safe Distance  Warning (SDW) alerts the driver if safe distance is not maintained.
Features and Speciﬁcations may vary model wise.
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY
BRAKING (AEB)
If the driver doesn't respond in
a near collision situation, the 
Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system will automatically 
apply limited braking to either reduce the vehicle speed, avoid the collision or lessen its 
consequences. The AEB - Pedestrian also works in case there are pedestrians crossing in front of the vehicle.
INTELLIGENT HEADLAMP
CONTROL (IHC)
To avoid distracting other road 
users from high-beam and to make night driving convenient for everyone, Intelligent HeadlampControl activates / deactivates thehigh-beam, depending on the oncoming trafﬁc and environmentsituation.

"IT’S HY T IME
TO MOVE UP TO THE HYBRID LIFE.
25 years ago, Toyota innovated a
brand-new way to drive – the self-charging 
hybrid electric technology. A smoother, silent 
and more eﬃcient drive that was engineered to 
accelerate the world to a better, greener and 
carbon-neutral future.  
Toyota’s self-charging hybrid electric technology 
combines the advantages
of a gasoline engine and an electric motor
to give you double the performance with
lesser emissions. The car can be driven on 
electric power as well as with the engine
and electric motor working together.
Unlike other cars, Toyota’s hybrid cars are 
self-charging. And with an unmatched 8-year 
hybrid battery warranty, Toyota’s hybrid 
technology is designed to make your every
drive simply awesome. Toyota has sold over 
2 crore hybrid cars across 140 countries. 
Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder is the newest 
and one of the most advanced addition to 
Toyota’s acclaimed hybrid legacy.
This is the age of the hybrid.
The age of no compromises.  
Where you can have it all –
the best of both worlds.
And more.  
It’s time for you to ride
the new wave.
It’s time for you to step
into the future.  
Because it’s HY TIME you
lived the hybrid life.  
 
Presenting
Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder.
An advanced SUV that gives you
the awesome advantages of
hybrid electric and petrol.
So that you can go ahead
and live the HY life!
